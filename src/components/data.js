          "It was a wonderful experience when I visited Shimla for the first time. It was a peak winters in Shimla and I happened to be placed in Delhi in my Job. Initially, I had shown some resistance to my Boss who had directed me to go on duty . This is because of peak winter season in January . Believe me when I stayed in Shimla for a couple of days , winters were all forgotton. Pollution free enviornment in Shimla, healthy food, calm and serene atmosphere made my stay so attractive that I fell in love with the place.Early morning you could see clouds at your feet and touching your palm.Tall trees and pony rides added beauty to the place.It was indeed my most memorable experience so much so after the very first visit, I am a regular visitor to the place every year.",

          "Beautiful mountain view off the beaten path.The trip may take up to ten hours as sometimes the road is barely there--that's an unexpected \"thrill\"--and it's rough going, but the scenery is worth it, both the destination and the trip there.Reckong Peo is also the commercial and administrative centre of the Kinnaur district as biggest market of entire district is located here and all important governmental as well as administrative offices are located at Reckong Peo. Tourists can take buses to visit all the important villages and other places of district from HRTC Bus Stand at Reckong Peo.",
